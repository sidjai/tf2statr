Description: logs.tf and sizzling stats are great match stats plugins however
  sometimes tournatment or season long stats are needed. Additionally, searching
  terms for teams and tournaments are hard to find having to traverse multiple
  websites and APIs. Even for single matches, this package
  parses the information into R for further analysis.
