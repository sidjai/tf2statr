#tf2statr

Query, download and clean TF2 match data

Tracking tools for TF2 matches have matured to the point that more detailed exploration is warranted. Right now the process is largely manual even with lightweight APIs and well curated datasets. This package hopes to give the user more power over what and where to look for data using R.

## Installation

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sidjai/tf2statr")
```
As a heads up, the package depends on rvest v 0.3.0 which at the moment can only be downloaded in the development version on github as follows

```r
# install.packages("devtools")
install_github("hadley/rvest")

```
