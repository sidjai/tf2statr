-- use the past 3 matches for each player and the team
-- per map stats as well

- create a stat like "wins above replacement" for TF2
-- specialize for each class "roamer, demo"
--- characterize roamer using heal percentage
-- use it to determine how much success is based on individual effort vs team chemistry or heads up plays not reflected in the stat line.
